    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<hr><p><font color=gray>Recently, it was my turn to share during the weekly company presentation, and I pondered over what I should talk about. By chance, I remembered a book I had read before, ‚ÄúModel Thinking.‚Äù At the time, I felt that it was indeed a great book, but unfortunately, I hadn‚Äôt delved into it thoroughly. The content of the book is quite extensive, filled with various academic models, and its thickness alone could intimidate many readers. Hence, without that pressure, there wouldn‚Äôt be this sharing opportunity.</font></p><hr><img src="https://images-1301786122.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/uPic/The-Model-Thinker.jpg" style="zoom:40%"><p align="center"><font face="Èªë‰Ωì" color=gray size=2.8>Author | Ngenie</font></p><a id="more"></a><p align="center"> <font face="Èªë‰Ωì" color=red size=6>1</font></p><h4 id="Questions-list"><a href="#Questions-list" class="headerlink" title="Questions list"></a><font face="Èªë‰Ωì" size=5>Questions list</font></h4><ol><li><p>Why should I read this book?</p></li><li><p>What is the core idea of this book?</p></li><li><p>How can one gradually acquire ‚Äúmodel thinking‚Äù?</p></li><li><p>What guidance does ‚Äúmodel thinking‚Äù provide for life and work?</p></li><li><p>After reading this book, what tools can I immediately use? What actions can be taken right away?</p></li></ol><p align="center"> <font face="Èªë‰Ωì" color=red size=6>2</font></p><h4 id="Deconstruction-of-this-book"><a href="#Deconstruction-of-this-book" class="headerlink" title="Deconstruction of this book"></a><font face="Èªë‰Ωì" size=5>Deconstruction of this book</font></h4><h5 id="2-1-Book-introduction"><a href="#2-1-Book-introduction" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Book introduction"></a>2.1 Book introduction</h5><p><img src="https://images-1301786122.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/%E6%96%AF%E7%A7%91%E7%89%B9%E4%BD%A9%E5%A5%87.PNG" alt="Scott Page"></p><p>The author of this book, <strong>Scott Page</strong>, is the ‚Äúguru‚Äù of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan and an external research fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. He is an expert in complexity and diversity studies. In 2012, he taught a popular open course called ‚ÄúModel Thinking‚Äù at the University of Michigan. This book is a condensed compilation of the essence of that course. You can find the course on Coursera at this address: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking</a>.</p><h5 id="2-2-Book-structure"><a href="#2-2-Book-structure" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Book structure"></a>2.2 Book structure</h5><p>The focus of this book lies in cultivating multi-model thinking. In the following mind map, I provide a hierarchical analysis of multi-model thinking and an understanding of the methodology. These insights are primarily derived from my comprehension of the book and compiled online resources.</p><p>Regarding the collection of models in this book, it encompasses 23 major categories. While a significant portion consists of mathematical models, there are also numerous case studies throughout the book. It is recommended to understand and learn based on these case studies.</p><p><img src="https://images-1301786122.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B/%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4-%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4%E5%AF%BC%E5%9B%BE.png" alt="Model Thinking-Mind map"></p><h5 id="2-3-Answering-questions"><a href="#2-3-Answering-questions" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Answering questions"></a>2.3 Answering questions</h5><ol><li>The purpose of reading this book is to acquire a mindset called ‚Äúmodel thinking,‚Äù or more straightforwardly, <strong>to learn the patterns of problem-solving approaches</strong>.</li><li>The core idea of this book is <strong>multi-model thinking</strong>. From the aforementioned mind map, it is evident how multi-model thinking is structured, its significance, and the methodology for employing it.</li><li>To develop one‚Äôs own multi-model thinking, there are four steps:<ul><li>First, become proficient in several models.</li><li>Reflect on past problems and reapply suitable models, practicing them again.</li><li>Utilize the <strong>‚Äúhypothesis-analogy‚Äù methodology</strong> mentioned in this book. When faced with a problem, creatively adjust hypotheses and then employ analogies to select the most suitable combination of models.</li><li>Continuously experiment and accumulate knowledge in real-world problem-solving to allow your network of models to grow.</li></ul></li><li>Model thinking provides a comprehensive set of problem-solving approaches for both life and work. Its effectiveness depends on an individual‚Äôs cultivation and application. At the very least, employing model thinking provides a more scientific basis when facing problems, avoiding blind actions and anxiety.</li><li>Personally, there are several models from the book that I can immediately utilize:<ul><li>Power-law distribution model, applicable to the operation of my self-media.</li><li>Network model, useful in practical work. I plan to explore Bayesian networks for problem-solving related to key characters in a script.</li><li>Entropy model, as I have recently encountered significant uncertainties in daily life, using the entropy model to address life‚Äôs issues.</li><li>Markov model, for determining what can yield long-term positive utility and distinguishing it from short-term utility, fostering a long-term perspective in life.</li></ul></li></ol><p align="center"> <font face="Èªë‰Ωì" color=red size=6>3</font></p><h4 id="My-takeaways"><a href="#My-takeaways" class="headerlink" title="My takeaways"></a><font face="Èªë‰Ωì" size=5>My takeaways</font></h4><p>Revisiting the sharing of this book has provided me with a deeper understanding of <strong>‚Äúmulti-model thinking‚Äù</strong>. Of course, this is also a method of model integration that I often utilize in my daily work. However, the mere act of selecting the appropriate models to solve problems is already quite challenging, not to mention the increasing number of models to learn, which leads to a rise in the time cost of trial and error and the possibility of minimal overall effectiveness. Therefore, ‚Äúmulti-model thinking‚Äù is not something that can be easily mastered after reading a few books or experiencing a few things. It requires continuous learning and improvement, much like Charlie Munger‚Äôs approach.</p><p>Another significant takeaway from this book‚Äôs sharing is that I once again tasted the sweetness of ‚Äúoutput.‚Äù Our long-standing school education has accustomed us to the ‚Äúlearning trap,‚Äù which primarily emphasizes ‚Äúinput,‚Äù and we have not learned to actively ‚Äúoutput.‚Äù Thus, <strong>I am considering establishing my own ‚Äúcontinuous output‚Äù system to drive continuous progress through output. Moreover, through ‚Äúoutput,‚Äù I can solidify my knowledge and experience a short-term sense of accomplishment</strong>. This definitely creates a positive feedback mechanism. As for the form of output, in this era of the Internet, it is no longer difficult; the key lies in establishing a well-structured system.</p><p align="center"> <font face="Èªë‰Ωì" color=red size=6>4</font></p><h4 id="Links-to-knowledge"><a href="#Links-to-knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Links to knowledge"></a><font face="Èªë‰Ωì" size=5>Links to knowledge</font></h4><ol><li><strong>‚ÄúBeauty of Algorithms‚Äù</strong> is a book that primarily focuses on explaining the use of algorithms to solve problems, and it shares some similarities with this book.</li><li><strong>‚ÄúSeeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger‚Äù</strong> is a classic book by Charlie Munger, where he emphasizes the concept of ‚Äúmultiple mental models‚Äù.</li><li>There are many online resources that compile Charlie Munger‚Äôs mental models, such as this <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‚Äúlist of 100 mental models recommended by Charlie Munger‚Äù</a>.</li></ol>]]></content>
